# The out-of-sample bootstrap process is repeated 1,000 times.
#
# Following Kamei et al. [37], we re-balance the
# training data that is labeled by each SZZ variant using the
# undersampling method

# TABLE 8: AUC scores of the B, AG, MA and RA models.
# We also show the ratios of the AUC scores of the B, AG and
# MA models to those of the RA model.
