#Table 1: Summary of the studied projects. “#Devs” represents the number of developers. “Med_size” represents the median
#change size. “Mean_size” represents the mean change size. In “Lifecycle” column, “Post-init” represents the post-initial version,
#“Pre-init” represents the pre-initial version.
