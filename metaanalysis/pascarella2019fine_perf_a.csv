# Table -- 4 All commits
# Results of the RQ2 considering all commits in the history of the subject
# software systems.
#
# In addition, to have a unique value that synthesizes preci- sion and recall
# we also measure the F-measure, i.e., the har- monic mean of precision and
# recall: F −Measure = 2 ·P recision ·Recall P recision + Recall
#
# It is unclear how cost-effectiveness is defined.
#
# It is unclear where the data is balanced
#
# For this reason, we adopt a time-sensitive analysis where the defectiveness
# of a commit c i is evaluated by a model trained using the data coming from
# the previous three months of history of the system considered.
