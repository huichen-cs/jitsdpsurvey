# Table 3: Summary of AUC values for within-project prediction and cross-project prediction
#
# To measure within-project performance, we select one project
# as the training dataset, perform tenfold cross-validation
# using data from the same project and then calculate the
# AUC value.
#
# We use all of the data of
# each project to build the within-project model. We perform
# ten combinations of cross-project prediction (11 projects -
# 1 for training). We then select the median of the ten AUC
# values. This median value is referred to as the cross-project
# AUC.
