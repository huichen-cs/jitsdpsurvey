# Table 4
# F1-score of bagging and stacking tech-

# tion.
#
# Tables 3 and 4 present PofB20 and F1-score of bagging and stacking techniques
# (based on decision trees) for just-in-time de- fect prediction using the
# dataset that we have described earlier in this section. From the table, we
# can see that stacking is bet- ter than bagging on some datasets (i.e., JDT,
# Mozilla, Platform C in terms of PofB20), while bagging is the better than
# stacking on some other datasets (e.g., Bugzilla, Columba and PostgreSQL C in
# terms of PofB20). Therefore, we propose to combine bagging and stacking to
# build a two-layer ensemble learning model.
