# In order to address our research questions, we conduct an empirical study
# using data from 11 open source projects, of which 6 projects (Bugzilla,
# Columba, Eclipse JDT, Mozilla, Eclipse Platform, PostgreSQL) are provided by
# Kamei et al. (2013) and 5 well-known and long-lived projects (Gimp, Maven-2,
# Perl, Ruby on Rails, Rhino) needed
