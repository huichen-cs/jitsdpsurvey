# Table 6: Best supervised predictor (A) vs. OneWay (B). The
# colorful cell indicates the size efect: green for large; yellow
# for medium; gray for small.
#
# Note that, following the practices of Yang et al. [54], we measure Precision,
# Recall, F1 and Popt at the efort = 20% point. In this study, in addition to
# Popt and ACC (i.e., Recall) that is used in Yang et alâ€™s work [54], we
# include Precision and F1 measures and they provide more insights about all
# the learners evaluated in the study from very diferent perspectives, which
# will be shown in the next section           
#
# When applying data mining algorithms to build predictive models, one
# important principle is not to test on the data used in training.  To avoid
# that, we used time-wise-cross-validation method which is also used by Yang et
# al. [54].

# Project Recall: r Popt: popt F1: f1 Precision:p
