# Table 5: Best unsupervised predictor (A) vs. OneWay (B). The
# colorful cell indicates the size efect: green for large; yellow
# for medium; gray for small.
#
# Note that, following the practices of Yang et al. [54], we measure
# Precision, Recall, F1 and Popt at the efort = 20% point. In this study,
# in addition to Popt and ACC (i.e., Recall) that is used in Yang et alâ€™s
# work [54], we include Precision and F1 measures and they provide
# more insights about all the learners evaluated in the study from
# very diferent perspectives, which will be shown in the next section
#
# When applying data mining algorithms to build predictive models,
# one important principle is not to test on the data used in training.
# To avoid that, we used time-wise-cross-validation method which is
# also used by Yang et al. [54].
#
# Recall: r
# Popt: Popt
# F1: f1
# Precision: p
