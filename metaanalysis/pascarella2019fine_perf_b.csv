# Table 5 - Partially Defective
# Results of the RQ2 considering only partially defective commits in the history of the
# subject software systems.
#
# In addition, to have a unique value that synthesizes preci- sion and recall
# we also measure the F-measure, i.e., the har- monic mean of precision and
# recall: F −Measure = 2 ·P recision ·Recall P recision + Recall
#
# It is unclear how cost-effectiveness is defined
