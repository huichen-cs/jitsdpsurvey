abstract = {Abstract ILDJIT, a new-generation dynamic compiler and virtual machine designed to support parallel compilation, is introduced here. Our dynamic compiler targets the increasingly popular ECMA-335 specification. The goal of this project is twofold: on one hand, it aims at exploiting the parallelism exposed by multi-core architectures to hide the dynamic compilation latencies by pipelining compilation and execution tasks; on the other hand, it provides a flexible, modular and adaptive framework for dynamic code optimization. The ILDJIT organization and the compiler design choices are presented and discussed highlighting how adaptability and extensibility can be achieved. Thanks to the compilation latency masking effect of the pipeline organization, our dynamic compiler is able to mask most of the compilation delay, when the underlying hardware exposes sufficient parallelism. Even when running on a single core, the ILDJIT adaptive optimization framework manages to speedup the computation with respect to other open-source implementations of ECMA-335.

abstract = {Microbial communities contain diverse bacteria that play important roles in every environment. Advances in sequencing and computational methodologies over the past decades have illuminated the phylogenetic and functional diversity of microbial communities from diverse habitats. Among the activities encoded in microbiomes are the abilities to synthesize and resist small molecules, yielding antimicrobial activity. These functions are of particular interest when viewed in light of the public health emergency posed by the increase in clinical antimicrobial resistance and the dwindling antimicrobial discovery and approval pipeline, and given the intimate ecological and evolutionary relationship between antimicrobial biosynthesis and resistance. Here, we review genomic and functional methods that have been developed for accessing the antimicrobial biosynthesis and resistance capacity of microbiomes and highlight outstanding examples of their applications.},

abstract = {Abstract With the growing demand for e-learning along with striving for excellence associated with globalization, there are worldwide calls for enhancing and assuring quality in e-learning, specifically in the context of the developing countries. Such calls for quality enhancement, accountability, added value, value for money, self-evaluation, and role players' satisfaction in higher education settings cannot go unheeded. Addressing the concerns regarding enhancing and assuring quality in e-learning, a comprehensive e-quality framework is developed by taking into account the pros and cons of the previous models, frameworks, and studies of e-quality. This e-quality framework offers a structured set of factors and benchmarks as a tool for practical quality work with e-learning in virtual institutions.},

abstract = {Abstract This study compares the effects of object-oriented and robot programming activities on programming achievement, abstraction, problem solving, and motivation. In the study, two consecutive experimental cases were conducted to examine the consistency of findings. The research sample comprises 81 tenth-grade students undergoing vocational secondary education. A total of 41 students participated in the first case that spanned 12 weeks, and 40 students participated in the second that spanned 8 weeks. After computational activities, the programming achievement scores significantly increased in all test groups. However, the achievement scores did not differ significantly between the groups. For the comparison groups, there was no statistically significant difference in the pre- and posttest scores of the formal and descriptive abstraction in both cases. However, a statistically significant increase was found in the formal (only Case 2) and descriptive abstraction scores of the students in the experimental groups. The abstraction results revealed a significant difference in the descriptive abstraction scores of Case 2 in favour of the experimental group. No statistically significant difference was found in the problem-solving scores within or between groups. In both cases, the motivation scores of the experimental groups were found to be statistically higher than those of the comparison groups.},

abstract = {The behavioral and neurobiological connections between play and the development of critical cognitive functions, such as attention, remain largely unknown. We do not yet know how these connections relate to the formation of specific abilities, such as spatial ability, and to learning in formal environments, such as in the classroom. Insights into these issues would be beneficial not only for understanding play, attention, and learning individually, but also for the development of more efficacious systems for learning and for the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Different operational definitions of play can incorporate or exclude varying types of behavior, emphasize varying developmental time points, and motivate different research questions. Relevant questions to be explored in this area include, How do particular kinds of play relate to the development of particular kinds of abilities later in life? How does play vary across societies and species in the context of evolution? Does play facilitate a shift from reactive to predictive timing, and is its connection to timing unique or particularly significant? This report will outline important research steps that need to be taken in order to address these and other questions about play, human activity, and cognitive functions.},

abstract = {Abstract In this paper we identify the most prominent problems of wireless multimedia networking and present several state-of-the-art solutions with a focus on energy efficiency. Three key problems in networked wireless multimedia systems are: (1) the need to maintain a minimum quality of service over time-varying channels; (2) to operate with limited energy resources; and (3) to operate in a heterogeneous environment. We identify two main principles to solve these problems. The first principle is that energy efficiency should involve all layers of the system. Second, Quality of Service is an essential mechanism for mobile multimedia systems not only to give users an adequate level of service, but also as a tool to achieve an energy-efficient system. Owing to the dynamic wireless environment, adaptability of the system will be a key issue in achieving this. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract The emergence of agile methods and practices has not only changed the development processes but might also have affected how companies conduct software process improvement (SPI). Through a set of complementary studies, we aim to understand how SPI has changed in times of agile software development. Specifically, we aim (a) to identify and characterize the set of publications that connect elements of agility to SPI, (b) to explore to which extent agile methods/practices have been used in the context of SPI, and (c) to understand whether the topics addressed in the literature are relevant and useful for industry professionals. To study these questions, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the literature identified in a previous mapping study, an interview study, and an analysis of the responses given by industry professionals to SPI-related questions stemming from an independently conducted survey study. Regarding the first question, we identified 55 publications that focus on both SPI and agility of which 48 present and discuss how agile methods/practices are used to steer SPI initiatives. Regarding the second question, we found that the two most frequently mentioned agile methods in the context of SPI are Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), while the most frequently mentioned agile practices are integrate often, test-first, daily meeting, pair programming, retrospective, on-site customer, and product backlog. Regarding the third question, we found that a majority of the interviewed and surveyed industry professionals see SPI as a continuous activity. They agree with the agile SPI literature that agile methods/practices play an important role in SPI activities but that the importance given to specific agile methods/practices does not always coincide with the frequency with which these methods/practices are mentioned in the literature.},
